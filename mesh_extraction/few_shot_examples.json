      "title": "Influences of fat restriction and lipase inhibition on gastric emptying in obesity.",
      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Accelerated gastric emptying of solids may play a role in the pathogenesis of obesity. Orlistat, a potent lipase inhibitor, induces fat malabsorption and body weight loss but might accelerate gastric emptying as a result of suppressed CCK release. The aim was to investigate the role of fat restriction and lipase inhibition in CCK release and gastric emptying.SUBJECTS: A total of 28 patients (three male (M)/25 female (F); mean (s.d.) BMI 37.4(3.9) kg/m2) entering a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.MEASUREMENTS: CCK release and gastric emptying by scintigraphy at the start (T0), after 1 month of an energy- and fat-restricted diet and placebo (T1), and after 1 month (T2) and 1 year (T3) of randomization to placebo or 120 mg orlistat three times a day.RESULTS: One month of dieting and a weight loss of 2.3 kg (2.1% of initial weight) did not affect gastric emptying of liquids and solids. Basal and meal-stimulated CCK levels remained unaltered. Placebo-treated subjects who continued the diet for 1 month demonstrated a borderline significant suppressed CCK secretion and a weight loss of 1.2 kg (1.0%) without an effect on gastric emptying. After 1 year, the CCK secretion recovered to or beyond values at the start. A significantly slower emptying of solids (17.6 (T3) versus 25.9 (T1)%/h) and a weight loss of 10.4 kg (9.9%) was observed. Subjects on 120 mg orlistat lost 2.5 kg (2.5%) after 1 month, and 9.8 kg (9.9%) after 1 year. Basal and postprandial CCK release decreased significantly after the first month of orlistat treatment but normalized after 1 year. Diet and lipase inhibition did not have any influence on gastric emptying.CONCLUSION: Energy and fat restriction of 1 month did not alter gastric emptying in the whole group. Continuation of the diet for 1 year resulted in a delayed gastric emptying of solids. Lipase inhibition did not result in a sustained depressed CCK release and the anticipated acceleration of gastric emptying did not occur.",

      "title": "[Epidermoid anal carcinoma].",
      "abstract": "Epidermoid carcinoma of the anus is a rare cancer, and conventionally affects elderly women. Its incidence is on the increase, at a younger age of onset, particularly within the male homosexual population. Main predisposing factors are sexually transmitted diseases and particularly human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, variety of sexual partners, smoking, homosexuality, history of uterine cervix cancer, and immunodepression. Warning signs of anal cancer are often non-specific. Therefore any atypical lesion should be systematically biopsied for histology. The evaluation assessment should include lung X-ray, abdominal CT scan, and often pelvis MNR or anal endosonography. Key prognostic factors are infiltration of the initial tumour and presence of lymph node metastasis. First-line treament of anal epidermoid carcinoma is radiotherapy, combined with chemotherapy for extensive forms.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the lifestyle related risk factors for breast cancer such as physical activity, cigarette smoking, the use of contraceptive pills and increased body weight between non-familial and familial breast cancer females in Jordan.METHODS: This study was carried out in the Kingdom of Jordan during the period 2000 through to 2002. A questionnaire was used to collect information from 99 females who were histologically and pathologically diagnosed for breast cancer. Data of the questionnaire was entered and analyzed using statistical package for social sciences.RESULTS: This study showed no significant difference between familial, non-familial breast cancer females and controls in the following risk factors: physical activity, contraceptive methods, and smoking. On the other hand, a statistically significant difference in weight was found between the familial breast cancer females, the total breast cancer females and the controls. In addition, the highest percentage of overweight and obese was found among postmenopausal breast cancer females.CONCLUSION: Postmenopausal obesity is a significant risk factor among Jordanian breast cancer females.",

      "title": "In vitro biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol in Aspergillus fumigatus.",
      "abstract": "Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) represents a mechanism for the attachment of proteins to the plasma membrane found in all eukaryotic cells. GPI biosynthesis has been mainly studied in parasites, yeast, and mammalian cells. Aspergillus fumigatus, a filamentous fungus, produces GPI-anchored molecules, some of them being essential in the construction of the cell wall. An in vitro assay was used to study the GPI biosynthesis in the mycelium form of this organism. In the presence of UDP-GlcNAc and coenzyme A, the cell-free system produces the initial intermediates of the GPI biosynthesis: GlcNAc-PI, GlcN-PI, and GlcN-(acyl)PI. Using GDP-Man, two types of mannosylation are observed. First, one or two mannose residues are added to GlcN-PI. This mannosylation, never described in fungi, does not require dolichol phosphomannoside (Dol-P-Man) as the monosaccharide donor. Second, one to five mannose residues are added to GlcN-(acyl)PI using Dol-P-Man as the mannose donor. The addition of ethanolamine phosphate groups to the first, second, and third mannose residue is also observed. This latter series of GPI intermediates identified in the A. fumigatus cell-free system indicates that GPI biosynthesis in this filamentous fungus is similar to the mammalian or yeast systems. Thus, these biochemical data are in agreement with a comparative genome analysis that shows that all but 3 of the 21 genes described in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GPI pathways are found in A. fumigatus.",

      "title": "Effects of different infusion volumes on hemodynamics of portal hypertension canines after hemorrhagic shock.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Portal hypertension (PHT) with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage as its chief complication is a very common disease with great harm to humans. The effects of infusion volume, speed, and type on hemodynamics in case of cirrhosis, PHT esophageal variceal bleeding, and their mechanism should be clarified. This study was designed to assess the effects of different infusion volumes on hemodynamics of PHT canines after hemorrhagic shock (HS).METHODS: PHT canine models were made by chronic embolization via coarctating half of the main portal vein with silk suture. Two weeks later, the models were subjected to hemorrhagic shock by quick femoral artery venesection. The canines were divided into two groups to resuscitate: one to receive a large volume of infusion (n=6) (large volume infusion group) and the other to receive a small volume of infusion (n=6) (small volume infusion group). Hemodynamic indexes of PHT canines after HS and infusion were observed closely.RESULTS: The PHT canines showed a series of hemodynamical changes in hemorrhagic shock stage, which aggravated hemodynamical disorder in PHT. After quick infusion, mean arterial pressure (MAP), inferior vena cava pressure (IVCP), portal venous pressure (PVP), portal vein pressure gradient (PVPG), portal vein blood flow (PVBF), hepatic artery blood flow (HABF) and hepatic blood flow (HBF) increased significantly. These indexes in the large volume infusion group were higher than those in the small volume infusion group. Portal vascular resistance (PVR), splanchnic vascular resistance (SVR), hepatic arterial resistance (HAR) decreased significantly, but PVP, PVPG, PVBF, HABF and HBF showed a rebounding increase above the baseline values in the large volume infusion group. The changes of PVP, PVPG, PVBF, HABF and HBF were in parallel with those of MAP and inferior vena cava pressure (IVCP), without a rebounding increase in the small volume infusion group. In the large volume infusion group PVPG increased earlier and more significantly than did PVP; moreover PVPG exceeded the baseline by 13%, making the possibility of rebleeding great. In the small volume infusion group, PVPG was lower than the baseline by more than 22%, indicating a small possibility of rebleeding. SVR and HAR were lower in the large volume infusion group. PVP, PVPG, PVBF, HABF and HBF were positively correlated with accumulated volume of vein infusion. PVR showed a positive correlation with accumulated volume of vein infusion in the small volume infusion group. HAR was negatively correlated with accumulated volume of vein infusion in the large volume infusion group.CONCLUSIONS: PHT canines after HS, resuscitated by vein infusion, may show a rebounding increase of PVP, PVPG, PVBF, HABF and HBF above the baseline values in the large volume infusion group but not in the small volume infusion group. A large volume infusion causes PVP, PVPG, PVBF, HABF and HBF to increase higher than does a small volume infusion.",
